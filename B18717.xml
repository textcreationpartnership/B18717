            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The CASE of the TRANSPORT-SHIPS <hi>For Reducing Ireland.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THERE is a Tax voted to be laid on the Tonnage of Shipping not only upon such who import Goods, but also on Coasters: To which Shipping there is already a considerable Sum of Mony due for reducing <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Shipping is that by which the Nation hath formerly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained its Riches and Greatness, and by all possible Ways and Means should be encouraged, more especially in these Times of War, and when more than ordinary Losses, such as few others in the Nation have sustained, have been the Portion of the Owners thereof.</p>
            <p>There is expressed (among the sundry Duties intended to be laid) 6 <hi> d. per</hi> Tonn on all Coasters: Which 6 <hi> d. per</hi> Tonn will be unequal, some Coasters making more and some less Voyages in a Year. That such a way of collecting the Duty cannot possibly be equal: But if instead of 6 <hi> d. per</hi> Tonn on Coasters, by the Voyage, there be 12 <hi> d. per</hi> Tonn laid on all English Shipping whatsoever, to be paid at two several Payments yearly. In such Case all the Shipping in the Kingdom will bear a just proportion, and although some Shipping may be abroad, and not come home in Two or Three Years, yet before such Ships enter their Goods, they may be liable to pay the yearly Tax so laid.</p>
            <p>And to the end that Strangers may baer a Ballance, who Import Goods, the laying 12 <hi> d. per</hi> Tonn on all Ships lying North from <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and 2 <hi> s. per</hi> Tonn on all Ships South from <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> inclusive for every Voyage they make; it may together raise about Eighty Thousand Pound <hi>per Annum,</hi> purely on the bottom of their Ships.</p>
            <p>But if the Ships who are under such calamitous Circumstances already, should be left Unpaid, and yet Taxed towards Raising Mony otherwise, then the Case will be very hard.</p>
            <p>For 12 <hi>d.</hi> a Tonn yearly paid for Shipping, is full as much as 4 <hi>s.</hi> in the Pound for Land; and if laid for four Years, will be equal to a Land-Tax for four Years to come: For take all the Shipping in <hi>England</hi> in an Averidge, and 'tis not worth five Pound <hi>per</hi> Tonn. But grant it be so Rated, then the Owner that has 500 <hi>l.</hi> in Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, or 100 Tonn, pays five Pound <hi>per Annum;</hi> which is just what the Farmer pays for 500 <hi>l.</hi> in Land.</p>
            <p>And 12 <hi> d. per</hi> Tonn on Shipping will appear to be very great, if it be considered. (1.) That the one half part of what makes a Compleat Ship, pays a considerable Custom already, <hi>viz</hi> Pitch, Tar, Iron, Masts, Sails and Cordage. (2.) It pays as it is Taxed by way of Stock; for there are many who have no other Estate but Shipping, yet are rated for it as their Stock.</p>
            <p>So that if what is now Voted pass into an Act, then Shipping will first pay at the Custom-house, next as Stock, and (3.) as high as Land; though but a floating Interest, and not at all to be compar'd with <hi>Terra firma.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yet if in the Parliaments Great Wisdom it shall seem meet that a Tax must come on the Tonnage of Shipping, purely as Shipping, 'tis humbly hoped that what is so Raised, shall be appropriated to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging the Debt which His Majesty, in His late most Gracious Speech, was pleased to Recommend to the Care of His House of Commons; that so Shipping may discharge the Debt due to Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, which in a few Years it will do, if the Tax be so laid.</hi>
